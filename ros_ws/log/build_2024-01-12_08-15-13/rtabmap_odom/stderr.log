[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrtabmap_sync.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rtabmap_sync", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rtabmap_sync" with
  any of the following names:

    rtabmap_syncConfig.cmake
    rtabmap_sync-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rtabmap_sync" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rtabmap_sync_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rtabmap_sync" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
